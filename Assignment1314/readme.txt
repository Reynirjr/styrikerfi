1. Start programm using (adjust classpath parameter -cp to let it point to the directory that contains the .class files):

javac -cp /home/ingolfur/workspace/tol401g_assignment13/bin/ Family.java
java -cp /home/ingolfur/workspace/tol401g_assignment13/bin/ Family

2. Run your program: is the printed output as  expected value? How would you see
that the program is running correctly?
